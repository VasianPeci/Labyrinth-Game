This is a simple maze game which I coded in Java using the JSwing GUI. The instructions are given to the player before the game starts.

In order to run it, you first have to create the table, storing the necessary data for user authentication and for the actions of saving or loading, using the MySQL script provided in the file _tableCreation.sql_.
Then, proceed with linking your code editor to MySQL using the appropriate MySQL jar file.
The final step is to replace the url, username and password in the code with your own MySQL credentials. I've commented these lines in each of the classes where they shall be replaced.
